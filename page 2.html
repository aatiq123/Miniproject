            Ecotourism in Kerala
        </h2>
     <blockquote><p class="kerela">
        Kerala's beauty is no longer a secret, and with its popularity have come crowds of visitors - both from within India and from overseas. Those crowds have congregated in specific areas of Kerala and led to problems for Kerala's wildlife, environment and local inhabitants: from pollution, to over-development, to lack of local empowerment and economic benefit from tourism.
        Local resources have become drained, including water, and upsetting that very delicate balance of flora and fauna. In Alleppey, where going on a house boat cruise is on the bucket-list for so many, the scenes are often of overcrowding of houseboats, islands of floating plastic and filth a-top inky black water.<br><br>
        The good news is that it is possible to travel in Kerala in a way that avoids the eyesores and mass-touristed spots, and more importantly supports local and community based initiatives where local Keralites see the benefits from tourism. We've got you covered for the best of sustainable travel in Kerala. <br><br>A word = before we begin = about use of the word “Ecotourism” in Kerala (and the rest of India). Ecotourism, unfortunately, is not always and only used for places that are focused on the principles of responsible tourism (ie. giving back to local communities, being environmentally sensitive and protecting local people and cultures). Instead, “Ecotourism” in India is often used to describe any tourist activity which involves the outdoors (such as walking, camping) and / or seeing wildlife. Whether or not it is eco-friendly or in any way sustainable. 
        Short on time or too busy to plan your own trip? There are plenty of local tour companies who can help such as eKeralaTourism who offer many of the highlights of Kerala or can offer tailor made itineraries.
        There are also global companies such as G Adventures who we have travelled with several times and recommend.

color:blue;">Kannur & Thottada Beach<br>
Kannur was our first port of call in Kerala after spending 3 weeks in beautiful Bangladesh. As our first taste of Kerala this year, Kannur did not disappoint.
Northern Kerala has been off the beaten track for many visitors to Kerala, who have focused more on the central and southern parts of the state. But that may be about to change. This year, Lonely Planet has named Northern Kerala as one of Asia's hotspots, and as a paradise for those seeking a quieter taste of Kerala. Small homestays line the palm fringed shores, with uninterrupted views out across the Arabian sea.

    Wayanad
</h4>
<p style=" font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
color:blue;">
    Little heard of - outside of India at least - Wayanad is a tranquil uphill oasis of homestays, quiet villages, scenic winding roads that take you through wild forests, and is a place where you can truly escape.
</p><br>
<p style=" font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
color:blue;">
    There's no “centre” to Wayanad as such, so to the first time visitor it can take some time to get your bearings. Sights and activities are spread all over the region, so wherever you base yourself, some road travel will be involved. Our best tip is to pick somewhere quiet to stay, un-plug and relax to the backdrop of the peaceful Wayanad scenery. It's better not to try to pack too much sightseeing in - but rather adapt to life at a slower pace.<br><br>
Jeep Safaris. Wildlife is a big attraction here, but we found our jeep drive at Tholpetty to be disappointing. After an early start and being inline at the forestry department by 6am to get our tickets, we got the second jeep out of the gates. We didn't see anything apart from a few deer.
Unfortunately the “Safari” consists of a 30 minute drive through the section of national park that is right next to the road, in a line of about 20 jeeps. If you're more than the second or third jeep in, your chances of seeing wildlife are likely non-existent. We should probably be happy that this means less interference for the animals! As an alternative, safaris at Muthunga are reportedly better than Tholpetty - and even better are the wildlife opportunities in neighbouring Karnataka state.<br><br>
Beyond the safaris, there are beautiful lakes to visit and countless hikes one can go on. There are several different boating lakes. Pookode lake has pedals-style boating (we did not visit here) and Banasura Sagar Dam is the place to go for those needing an adrenaline kick - on a speedboat. There is also a slow ferry that you can go on around the lake, at 12 midday.
